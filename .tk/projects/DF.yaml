      title: Validate priority range (1-4) on add, edit, and ops layers
      status: open
      priority: 1
      tags: [bug, validation]
      notes: 'tk add --priority -5 and --priority 99 are silently accepted. The list command displays P-5 and P99. The show command says ''Priority: -5 (unknown)''. Priority must be restricted to 1-4 at the add, edit, and ops layers. The validate command should also catch invalid priorities.'

      title: Reject empty task titles on add and edit
      status: open
      priority: 1
      tags: [bug, validation]
      notes: tk add '' and tk edit --title '' both succeed, creating phantom tasks with no title. validate catches this after the fact, but the commands should reject empty/whitespace-only titles at creation and edit time.

      title: Reject empty and whitespace-containing tags
      status: open
      priority: 2
      tags: [bug, validation]
      notes: tk tag DF-01 '' succeeds and stores an empty string tag, rendering as [] in list output. Tags with spaces like 'tag with spaces' are also accepted. Empty tags should be rejected, and tags with spaces should either be rejected or normalized to hyphens.

      title: Fix misleading --force hint on tk done for non-open tasks
      status: open
      priority: 1
      tags: [bug]
      notes: When running tk done on an already-done or dropped task, the error says 'Use --force to remove blockers and complete anyway' but the problem is the task status, not blockers. --force still fails. The hint should only appear when the error is actually about blockers.

      title: Error or warn when conflicting list filters are combined
      status: open
      priority: 2
      tags: [bug]
      notes: tk list --ready --blocked silently shows only ready tasks, ignoring --blocked. tk list --done --ready shows only done tasks. The shouldIncludeTask function uses an else-if chain so only the first matching filter wins. Users get silently wrong results. Should either error on conflicting filters or combine them with OR logic.

      title: Truncate or cap long titles in list table output
      status: open
      priority: 2
      tags: [bug, display]
      notes: A 1000-character title causes every row in tk list to be padded to 1000+ characters wide. The table renderer in output.go calculates column width from the max content. Add a max width or truncate long titles with ellipsis.

      title: Document the find command in userguide.md
      status: open

      tags: [docs]
      notes: tk find exists and works (case-insensitive substring search across tasks and waits) but is not mentioned anywhere in userguide.md.

      title: Simplify project new to remove redundant id argument
      status: open
      priority: 2
      tags: [ux]
      notes: 'project new requires three identifiers: tk project new backyard --prefix BY --name ''Backyard Redo''. The positional id (''backyard'') is invisible in tk projects output and mostly redundant. Consider making prefix the primary identifier and deriving id from it, or making id optional.'

      title: Rename wait resolve --as flag to something intuitive
      status: open
      priority: 3
      tags: [ux]
      notes: The flag for providing a resolution description is --as, which reads like 'resolve as [status]' not 'resolve with [description]'. Consider --resolution, --reason, or --note instead.

      status: open
      priority: 3
      blocked_by: [DF-01]
      tags: [ux]
      notes: tk list --p1 works but tk add --p1 does not (unknown flag). Users expect priority shorthands to work everywhere --priority does.

      title: Reject newlines in task titles
      status: open
      priority: 3
      tags: [bug, validation]
      notes: tk add 'line one\nline two' creates a task with a multi-line title. This breaks list table formatting since it assumes one row per task.

      status: open
      priority: 4
      blocked_by: [DF-03]
      tags: [bug, validation]
      notes: tk edit DF-01 --tags='foo,,bar' creates three tags including an empty string in the middle. Split-and-trim logic should filter out empty entries.

      title: Add open-task warning to project delete
      status: open
      priority: 4
      tags: [ux]
      notes: project delete requires --force (good) but does not tell you why caution is needed. It should say something like 'This project has 4 open tasks' before requiring --force.
